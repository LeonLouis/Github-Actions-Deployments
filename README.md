# Github-Actions-Deployments

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate various CI/CD workflows. These actions streamline the development process by automating deploying of code. Below is a detailed description of the workflows currently implemented, including the triggers, steps, and purposes of each.

### Deployment Workflow

#### Purpose:
Automates the deployment of the website to a development or production environment.

#### Triggers:
- push event on branch: `main` (production deployment)
- push event on branch: `development` (development deployment)

#### Steps:

##### 1. Checkout Code:
- Uses the `actions/checkout` action to pull the latest code from the repository..

##### 2. Set Up Environment:
- Configures the deployment environment, such as setting up server credentials.

##### 3. Deploy Code:
- Deploys the files to the specified environment

        port: ${{ secrets.FTP_LIVE_PORT }}
```

## Note

All environment variables should use secret variables in Github. Using secret variables in GitHub Actions is a critical security measure that helps protect sensitive data, ensures consistent and secure workflow execution, and adheres to industry best practices. By leveraging secret variables, you can automate your CI/CD processes with confidence, knowing that your confidential information is securely managed.

# Github-Actions-Deployments

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate various CI/CD workflows. These actions streamline the development process by automating deploying of code. Below is a detailed description of the workflows currently implemented, including the triggers, steps, and purposes of each.

### Deployment Workflow

#### Purpose:
Automates the deployment of the website to a development or production environment.

#### Triggers:
- push event on branch: `main` (production deployment)
- push event on branch: `development` (development deployment)

#### Steps:

##### 1. Checkout Code:
- Uses the `actions/checkout` action to pull the latest code from the repository..

##### 2. Set Up Environment:
- Configures the deployment environment, such as setting up server credentials.

##### 3. Deploy Code:
- Deploys the files to the specified environment 

## SFTP WP Engine Deployment Action

### How to generate New SSH Key

1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt window from your computer

2. Use ssh-keygen to generate a new key as shown below:
    - `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/wpengine_ed25519`
 
3. Hit enter or return to leave it the passphrase blank.
    - If you wish to set a password, you may. However the security benefit is debatable and it cannot be recovered if lost.

### Create SSH Config 

1. On your local machine, first navigate to your .ssh directory.
    - MacOS â€“ Open Terminal and type:
        - `cd ~/.ssh/`
    - Windows â€“ Use Git Bash and navigate to:
        - /c/Users/[youruser]/.ssh/

2. To create the file run:
    - touch config

3. Open file and paste following contents:
    - `Host *.ssh.wpengine.net`
      `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/wpengine_ed25519`
      `IdentitiesOnly yes ` 

4. Save file

### Use SSH Config to Connect with an Alias ( For Multiple SSH and be able to specify each )

1. Update the config file with the following contents:
- `Host ALIAS`
  `User ENVIRONMENTNAME`
  `Hostname ENVIRONMENTNAME.ssh.wpengine.net`
  `PreferredAuthentications publickey`
  `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/YOURKEYFILENAME_ed25519`
  `IdentitiesOnly yes`
- Update <b>ALIAS</b> to the alias name you wish to use.
- Update <b>ENVIRONMENTNAME</b> to the unique WP Engine name of the environment. This is also the name of the User.
- Update <b>~/.ssh/YOURKEYFILENAME_ed25519</b> to your private key file path. This should typically be in the `~/.ssh/` directory and end in `_ed25519`.

### Add Public SSH to WP Engine SSH Keys

1. Login to the User Portal
2. Click your name, at the top right
3. Select My Profile
4. Click SSH Keys
5. Select Create SSH Key
6. Copy and add Public SSH from the generated SSH on your local ( file end in `.pub` )
7. Click Add SSH key

### Test SSH Key

Once the SSH Key is added in the WP Engine test the SSH if it connects

- type `ssh ALIAS`

## Note

All environment variables should use secret variables in Github. Using secret variables in GitHub Actions is a critical security measure that helps protect sensitive data, ensures consistent and secure workflow execution, and adheres to industry best practices. By leveraging secret variables, you can automate your CI/CD processes with confidence, knowing that your confidential information is securely managed.
